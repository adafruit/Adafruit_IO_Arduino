Adafruit IO Arduino Library
---------------------------
This library provides a simple device independent interface for interacting with Adafruit IO using Arduino.
It allows you to switch beween WiFi (ESP8266, M0 WINC1500, & WICED), Cellular (32u4 FONA), and Ethernet (Ethernet FeatherWing)
with only a two line change in your sketch.
